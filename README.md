# BethiniPie_SkyrimSSE_INI_settingsComparison

 Reference sheets to visually catalog settings added and altered by Bethini Pie, mostly so I can make notes for Community Shaders compatibility.

## File naming convention:

 SettingsSOURCE_parameter0_parameter1_parameter2

| SectionName | Description |
|---|---|
|`SettingsSource`|Guide or selected preset with the last word CAPITALIZED.|
|`parameter0`|Will say `RecTweaks` if the **`Apply Recommended Tweaks`** button was pressed in Bethini Pie's interface; absent if not this button was not pressed.|
|`parameter1`|Will say `withPP` if settings selected are based on whether Post Processing (Reshade, Community Shaders, or ENB) will be enabled, which will be basically always; absent if not the case.|
|`parameter2`|Will say `BethiniPresets` if the **`Bethini Presets`** option was selected in Bethini Pie's interface; will say `VanillaPresets` if the **`Vanilla Presets`** option was selected in Bethini Pie's interface; will say `SSE` if the settings are generated via the default Skyrim Special Edition launcher.|

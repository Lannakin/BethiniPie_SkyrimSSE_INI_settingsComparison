# BethiniPie_SkyrimSSE_INI_settingsComparison

 Reference sheets to visually catalog settings added and altered by Bethini Pie, mostly so I can make notes for Community Shaders compatibility.  These may already be documented somewhere, but I was not able to find them and I wanted them to be in some kind of idiot-friendly cheat sheet format b/c I am an idiot and I will be using them.  For me.
 
 Probably not going to include presets like Ultra vs High etc. Really unlikely to compare anything with the old Bethini's generated settings, as I feel they are not going to be any more compatible with Community Shaders, which is 99% of the reason I wanted to make comparisons (supposedly, the old version's settings were more complex and diverse; CS expects INI settings generated by Skyrim SE, not by 3rd parties; *more* settings are not going to be more compatible...and more importantly, that sounds like more work).

## File naming convention

 SettingsSOURCE_parameter0_parameter1_parameter2

| SectionName | Description |
|---|---|
|`SettingsSource`|Guide or selected preset with the last word CAPITALIZED.|
|`parameter0`|Will say `RecTweaks` if the **`Apply Recommended Tweaks`** button was pressed in Bethini Pie's interface; absent if not this button was not pressed.|
|`parameter1`|Will say `withPP` if settings selected are based on whether Post Processing (Reshade, Community Shaders, or ENB) will be enabled, which will be basically always; absent if not the case.|
|`parameter2`|Will say `BethiniPresets` if the **`Bethini Presets`** option was selected in Bethini Pie's interface; will say `VanillaPresets` if the **`Vanilla Presets`** option was selected in Bethini Pie's interface; will say `SSE` if the settings are generated via the default Skyrim Special Edition launcher.|
